<h1> Hello </h1>

I have a couple of reasons to test this. Let's see what happens to variables in markdown

Ok, nvm, it failed. 

Next, let us test image tags over here .. 

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IceCereal/IceCereal.github.io/master/img/blog-images/i-made-a-website-that-hit-a-million-views-in-2-weeks/Beta/1Million.png" alt = "HEY">

It actually works !! 

Let me try to include this in my web-page and let's see what happens !!

Pretty Excited for this !!!
